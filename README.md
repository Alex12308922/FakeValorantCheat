# Fake Valorant Cheat

This is a fun Python project designed as a harmless troll to prank your friends.  
The program creates a `.txt` file on the Desktop with a message explaining why cheating is bad.  
It also creates a `.txt` file in the startup programs directory to remind the user not to cheat.  

The file creation is triggered when the user clicks the "Apply" button in the app.
