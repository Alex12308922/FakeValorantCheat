# Fake Valorant Cheat

This is a fun Python project designed as a harmless troll to prank your friends.  
The program creates a `.txt` file on the Desktop with a message explaining why cheating is bad.  
It also creates a `.txt` file in the startup programs directory to remind the user not to cheat.  

The file creation is triggered when the user clicks the "Apply" button in the app.

## Installation

- **Option 1:** Download the `.exe` file and send it to one of your friends.
- **Option 2:** Download the Python script and customize it as you wish.
